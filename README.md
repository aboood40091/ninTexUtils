# ninTexUtils (Python version)
Library for handling textures from Nintendo platforms (Wii U, for now).  
This repository was created so that I don't need to duplicate this code in every project I have, as well as to have a unified place for dealing with Nintendo textures.  
Support is planned for Nintendo Switch textures as well (XTX and BNTX).
